Cascading Change Log

unreleased

  Updated c.f.Flow and c.c.Cascade log messages to be easier to follow when executing many flow instances simultaneously.

  Added compression flag to c.s.TextLine. Can now toggle compression (Hadoop style compression) per Tap instance. This prevents
  clusters with complression enabled by default to export text files with a .deflate extension.

  Added support for bypassing Hadoop OutputCollector via Tap.setUseTapCollector() method. Setting to true will force
  Cascading to use the c.t.TapCollector instead. This bypasses bugs in Hadoop with custom FileSystem types. This will
  always be true for http(s) and s3tp filesystems when using a c.t.Hfs Tap type (atleast until HADOOP-3021 is resolved).

  Added c.t.TupleCollector, complementing c.t.TupleIterator, for directly writing Tuple instances out via a c.t.Tap
  instance.

  Added c.f.FlowListener so that c.f.Flow instances can fire events on starting, completed, and throwable.

  Changed c.t.h.S3HttpFileSystem so it can now create files remotely.

  Renamed cascading.spill.threshold to cascading.cogroup.spill.threshold, so there is less a chance of collision.

  Made numerous optimizations to improve overall performance.

  Changed c.p.Operators to push c.o.Operation results directly through to next operation without intermediate collection. This should
  improve pipelining of large result streams and lower runtime memory footprint.

  Changed c.c.Cascade so it now runs Flows in parallel if Hadoop is clustered, and there are no dependencies between the Flows.

  Moved c.Cascade and related classed to c.cascade package. Wanted to preempt any future ugliness.

  Added support in c.t.h.S3HttpFileSystem for these properties: fs.s3tp.awsAccessKeyId and fs.s3tp.awsSecretAccessKey

0.3.0

  Added ability to push Log4j logger properties to mapper/reducer via JobConf.
  Use jobConf.set("log4j.logger","logger1=LEVEL,logger2=LEVEL")

  Added missing equals() and hashCode() in c.t.MultiTap.

  Added c.t.h.ZipInputFormat (and ZipSplit) to support zip files. c.s.TextLine supports transparent
  reading of zip files if the filename ends with .zip, but cannot write to them. This code is
  loosely based on HADOOP-1824. If the underlying filesystem is hdfs or file, splits will be created
  for each ZipEntry. Otherwise ZipEntries are iterated over to be more stream friendly. Progress status is
  supported.

  Added http, https, and s3tp read-only file systems to Hadoop. Use these URLs, respectively:
  http://, https://, and s3tp://AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY@bucket-name/key

  Added c.o.t.DateFormatter supporting text formatting of time stamps created by c.o.t.DateParser.

  Fixed bug where in complex assemblies, some Scopes were not resolved.

  Fixed bug where tap instances were not being inserted before some CoGroup joins if there was a previous Group in the assembly.

  Upgraded JGraphT to 0.7.3

  Changed c.t.SpillableTupleList allows for iteration across entries.

  Changed c.f.FlowException to optionally allow for printing of underlying pipe graph for debugging.

  Added c.o.t.FieldFormatter function to format Tuples into complex strings using j.u.Formatter formatting.

  Added c.o.a.Last aggregator to find the last value encountered in a group.

  Changed c.o.a.Max and c.o.a.Min to maintain original value type. Will return null if no values are encountered.

  Changed c.o.a.First to use Fields.ARG by default. Removed Fields constructor.

  Added c.t.Fields.join(Fields...) method to allow for joining multiple Fields instances into a new instance.

  Can retrieve Tuple values by field name through the TupleEntry class via the get(String) method.

  Added c.t.TupleCollector interface to simplify the operation interfaces.

  Added a Debug filter that will print to either stderr or stdout. Useful for debugging stream transformations.

  Added CascadingTestCase base test class

  Added Insert Function that allows for literal values to be inserted into the Tuple stream.

0.2.0

  CoGroup will now spill to disk on extremely large co-groupings. Configurable via "cascading.spill.threshold".
  Defaults to 10k elements.

  java.util.Properties instances can be used to set defauls for FlowConnectors.

  Fix for InnerJoin, the default join for CoGroup.

  Introduced MultiTap to support concatenation of files into a pipe assembly.

  RegexParser now fails on a failed match. Prevents it being used or behaving as a filter.

  Fixed bug with PipeAssembly instances not properly being assimiliated into the pipeGraph.

  Fixed assertion error thrown by JGraphT.

  Renamed Tap method deleteOnInit to deleteOnSinkInit.
