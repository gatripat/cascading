=== How do I convert String tuple values to their primitive types for more efficient storage? ===

 Use the c.o.Identity class to coerce values to new types. If a tuple value is "1234", you could coerce it to a Integer. For example:
{{{
  pipe = new Each( pipe, new Fields("index_string"), new Identity( new Fields("index"), Integer.class), Fields.ALL );
}}}

=== How do I create my own filter class? ===

 Your new filter must extend c.o.Operation and implement c.o.Filter. Your implementation must always declare the fields Fields.ALL. For example:
{{{
  public ANewFilter()
    {
    super( ANY, Fields.ALL );
    }
}}}

=== How do I print my tuple stream for debugging? ===

 Use the c.o.Debug filter. By default it will print your tuple stream to stderr.
