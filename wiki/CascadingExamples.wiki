#summary Index of usage examples for Cascading.

= Introduction =

Details in using the examples provided as separate [http://code.google.com/p/cascading/downloads/list downloads].

= Example Details =
 * ApacheLogCascade
 * CrawlDataWordCountCascade


= Running =

Two sample applications, with source are provided on the downloads page. 

To give Cascading a quick whirl, download the cascading archive and one of the example applications. Untar them both into a new directory so that you have a 'cascading' and either 'loganalysis' or 'wordcount' directories in the same parent directory.

Next, you must initialize your local Hadoop environment. For example, call
{{{
export HADOOP_HOME=~/hadoop
export PATH=$HADOOP_HOME/bin/:$PATH
}}}
where `HADOOP_HOME` points to the root of your Hadoop installation.

Finally, per the README.TXT file in your example application, call
{{{
ant jar
hadoop jar ./build/example.jar args...
}}}
